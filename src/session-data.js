    No-bake choc hazelnut and coconut slice. Super simple, staple ingredients, totally yum! . .
    If you don‚Äôt have/like hazelnuts you could use pecans instead- or even almonds (but that would be my last choice- and you might need extra sweetener). I used vegan milk choc for the topping, and wouldn‚Äôt recommend subbing for a darker choc unless you add extra sweetener in- it‚Äôs needed to balance out the flavours x
    .
    Base
    .
    1 cup (activated or freshly roasted) hazelnuts
    2 Tbsp coconut flour
    1/4 cup raw cacao powder
    1/4 cup pure maple syrup
    2 Tbsp coconut oil, melted
    .
    1. Add nuts, flour and cacao to a food processor, and blitz until nuts are finely chopped.
    2. Add remaining ingredients and pulse to combine well. Press into the base of a small slice tin lined with baking powder (mine was 15cm square). Set aside.
    .
    Coconut layer.
    .
    3 cups shredded coconut
    1 tsp vanilla extract
    1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
    1/4 cup maple syrup
    1/4 cup coconut milk
    .
    1. Add all ingredients to a bowl and combine. Pour over base and set in fridge.
    .
    Choc ganache topping
    .
    100g vegan milk chocolate** 3 Tbsp coconut milk.
    .
    1. Finely chop up chocolate and set in a bowl (the finer, the better). Heat coconut milk (until hot, but NOT boiling point), pour over chocolate and whisk together. Pour over coconut layer, then set in the fridge. *Store in an airtight container, in the fridge/freezer. ** I would recommend using dark chocolate, as the extra sweetness is needed for this slice. If you DO use dark chocolate, then I‚Äôd recommend adding sweetener.`,
